===== 1 Intro =====
In the following we define the tiny language used to define how
classes propagate through builtins. This is used in the builtins.csv
to specify class propagation, using the "Class" tag. To specify the
class propagation for a builtin, or a abstract builtin, it is
specified as
  Class(<expr>)

or
  Class(<expr_1>,<expr_2>,<expr_3>,..,<expr_n>)

Where the expressions follow the syntax of the language. The language
itself is vaguely similar to regular expressions in that it matches
incoming types. But rather than having a match as a result, the
expression language allows to explicitly state what the result is.



===== 2 Class Specification =====

=== 2.1 Basics ===
Every expression is interpreted either in LHS or RHS mode. In LHS mode
it matches the classes of arguments to the expression, in RHS it emits the
expression as output classes. For example 
  double>char

will attempt to match a double argument, and if one is found, it will
emit a char result. Iff for the overall expression, all input arguments
have been consumed by matching, it will result in an overall match,
and the emitted results wil be returned.

At any point there will be a partial match, which consists of the next
input argument index to be read, and the result classes emitted. For
example after the above expression, if one attempts to match the input
arguments [double, double], the partial result will refer to the 2nd
argument, and will have 'char' as an output.



=== 2.2 Language features ===
The language supports the following syntax, with LHS and RHS semantics showing:

2.2.1 Operators
expr1 > expr2
  LHS,RHS: will attempt to match expr1 as a LHS, and if it is a match,
  will run expr2 as a RHS expression and emit the results

expr1 & expr2
  LHS: will attempt to match expr1 as a LHS, and if it is a match,
  will attempt to match expr2
  RHS: will run expr1 as a RHS, then will run expr2 as a RHS expression

expr1 | expr2
  LHS: will attempt to match expr1 and expr2 indenpendently, then will
  return whichever succesful match consumed the most arguments.
  RHS: will emit the union of the emitted results of expr1 and expr,
  run as RHS expressions. Both expr1 and expr2 must have the same
  number of emitted result. If not, it will throw a runtime error.

Just like in other langauges, & precedes | precedes >.



2.2.2 Non-parametric Expressions
2.2.2.1 Builtins
The class propagation language supports the following builtins
double
float
uint8
uint16
uint32
uint64
int8
int16
int32
int64
char
logical
function_handle
  LHS: will attempt to match the builtin class
  RHS: will emit the builtin class

2.2.2.2 Groups of Builtins
Certain builtins are grouped together using union
float     is the same as 'single|double'
uint      is the same as 'uint8|uint16|uint32|uint64'
sint      is the same as 'int8|int16|int32|int64'
int       is the same as 'uint|sint'
numeric   is the same as 'float|int'
matrix    is the same as 'numeric|char|logical'

2.2.2.3 Non-parametric language features
none
  LHS,RHS: will result in a succesful match, without consuming inputs
  or emitting results
begin
  LHS,RHS: will match if the next argument is the first argument (no
  arguments have been matched)
end
  LHS,RHS: will match if all arguments have been matched
any
  LHS: will match the next argument, no matter what it is, if there
  is an argument left to match
  RHS: error
parent
  will substitute the expression that is defined for the abstract
  parent builtin. If the parent builtin does not define class
  propagation information, will substitute 'none'.


2.2.3 Functions
coerce(replaceExpr, expr)
  will take every single argument, and execute replaceExpr on it
  individually and independently. The replace Expr has to be either
  not a match, or a match and emit a single result. If it does, this
  result gets replaced as a the new argument. 
  It will the take the new set of arguments, and execute the second
  argument 'expr' with it, either as LHS or RHS depending on whether
  the coerce itself was exected as LHS or RHS, and return the result
  of that.
  This allows operand coercion. For example a function may convert all
  incoming char or logical arguments to doubles, which would be done
  using
    coerce(char|logical>double, expr)

opt(expr)
  is the same as 'none|expr'
  LHS: will attempt to match the expression. If it fails, still
  returns a succesful match, but it does so by matching 'none'.
  RHS: This will likely cause an error, because the union of two match
  results must both result in the same number of emited outputs.


2.2.4 Number
<number>
  Same as the argument with the same index as the given number. So 0
  will match (LHS) or emit (RHS) the class of the first argument.
  Negative numbers will match from the back, so -1 is the clas of the
  last argument.

===== 3. Extra Notes on Semantics =====



=== 3.1 RHS can have LHS sub-expressions, and vice versa ===
An expression may emit results even if it is run as a LHS
expression, and an expression run as RHS may match more elements. For
example for
  double > (char > logical & int16)

the 'char' expression will get matched, due to the second '>'
operation. Similarly,
  (double & char > logical) > int16

An equivalent expression, will emit the logical because of the second '>'.



=== 3.2 Overall execution of Class tag ===
Overall, expressions are evaluated as LHS expressions, so
  Class(double)

will attempt to match a incoming double argument, and have no returns.

Multiple arguments to the Class tag get transformed internally to
their union, so
  Class(expr_1,expr_2,..,expr_n)
is equivalent to
  Class(expr_1 | expr_2 | .. | expr_n)
This only applies for arguments to the class tag, comma is not an
operator equivalent to | in general.



=== 3.3 Greedy matching ===
While the language looks similar to regular expressions, it is in fact
different: all matching is done greedily.
So the expression
  (double | none) & (double)
When run on a single double input, will not match. This is because the
union will greedily match the longest expression, which will consume
the input argument.



===== 4 Examples =====
Class((double|single)&(double|single)>double) 
  will match two floats, and result in a double

Class(coerce(char|logical>double, numeric>0))
  will convert any char and logical arguments to double, then will
  match any single numeric argument, and emit the type of that argument

Class(char&char>char, numeric&(0|double)>0,  (double|1)&numeric>1)
  Either two chars will result in a char, or, if two arguments are
  numeric, they should either have the same class or at least one
  argument has to be a double, in which case it will return the class
  of the other argument.

Class(none>double)
  If there are no inputs, will result in a double (i.e. this models a
  double constant).

Class(parent&opt(any))
  Matches whatever the parent builtin matches, but will allow for one
  extra argument of any type.
